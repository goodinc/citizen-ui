      <p>Our Terms of Service lay out the rules we use to govern the intellectual property on this site.

        <p>Adults Only. The Service is intended for adults only. You affirm that you are either more than 18 years of age, or an emancipated minor, or possess legal parental or guardian consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Service. In any case, you affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the GOOD.is website is not intended for children under 13.

        <p>A cash refund will be issued to paid subscribers upon written request to GOOD Magazine's customer service department: GDMcustserv [at] cds-global.com. Refunds are calculated based on the prorated value of un-served issues to the subscriber. For example: If 3 of 6 copies have been served (delivered) then 50% of the subscription fee will be refunded.</p>

        <p>Entire Agreement. The Terms of Service, including GOOD's Copyright Policy and Privacy Policy which are hereby incorporated by reference, constitute the entire agreement between you and GOOD and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and GOOD.</p>

        <p>Governing Laws. The Terms of Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

        <p>Dispute Resolution. Except as provided herein, no civil action with respect to any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service may be commenced until the matter has been submitted to JAMS for mediation. The parties agree that any such mediation shall take place in Los Angeles County, California, USA. Either party may commence mediation by providing to JAMS and the other party a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of the dispute and the relief requested. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a mediator from JAMS' panel of neutrals, and in scheduling the mediation proceedings. The parties covenant that they will participate in the mediation in good faith, and that they will share equally in its costs. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator and any JAMS employees, are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any litigation or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation. Either party may seek equitable relief prior to the mediation to preserve the status quo pending the completion of that process. Except for such an action to obtain equitable relief, neither party may commence a civil action with respect to the matters submitted to mediation until after the completion of the initial mediation session, or 45 days after the date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever occurs first. Mediation may continue after the commencement of a civil action, if the parties so desire. The provisions of this section may be enforced by any Court of competent jurisdiction, and the party seeking enforcement shall be entitled to an award of all costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys' fees, to be paid by the party against whom enforcement is ordered.</p>

        <p>Waiver and Severability. The failure of GOOD to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties to this Agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>

        <p>Notices. GOOD may provide you with notices, including, without limitation, those regarding changes to the Terms of Service and other service-related announcements, by email and/or by postings on the Service (for example, by posting to the blog, or on the relevant page(s) of the Service affected by such changes).</p>

        <p>Trademarks. GOOD, the GOOD logo, and other GOOD logos and names are trademarks of GOOD. You agree not to display or use these trademarks in any manner without GOOD's prior, written consent.</p>

        <p>Contact Information. Please send any questions or comments, or report any Terms of Service violations, to info [at] goodinc.com.</p>
