      <p>I have the good fortune of working in a building and a neighborhood teeming with creative people.  A few months ago Skrillex, the one and only, had a rehearsal space downstairs and from the hours of 9pm - 3am you could feel our old warehouse shake with bass from his set.  I often found myself peeking into the giant hall to see what they were up to and was transfixed by the half pipe the team had set up.  Every time I looked in the lonely miniramp sat quietly, it was calling to me.  </p>

      <p>I had the good fortune of becoming friends with the team that ran the space and inquired about the fate of the lonely ramp, making it clear my buddy Will and I could 'take it off their hands' if they didn't have a place for it when they left the space.  Funny enough the moment came when they were prepping to leave and we were offered the ramp, the one catch, we had to move it, quick.  I reached out to everyone I knew who had space in the neighborhood and almost everyone quickly said no, I couldn't house a miniramp in their space.  I persisted and began reaching out to people who knew people.  At last I was connected to two guys who had just rented a spot with an amazing roof that was already home to a fledgling home made skate park.  They were super into the idea of having Skrillex's ramp on their roof and we made arrangements to move the ramp and get it set up.  </p>

      <p>It just so happens this roof is right next to the ramp where the 5 South turns into the 10 West.  Strangers drive by constantly and we knew it was a matter of time before the whole neighborhood was skating the ramp.  We knew from the get go that the ramp would be the spot this summer and Will and I recently ran into a crew of young guys skating it who first spotted the ramp from the freeway.  It was awesome to see these kids killing it, dancing on their boards and having a blast.  </p>

      <p>Making a skatepark has always been a childhood dream.  I feel good knowing that strangers are enjoying the dream as much as I am.  I hope they continue to take care of our new playground!</p>

      <p>P.S. I make things for strangers for a living.  Check out the company I co-founded - apliiq.com - and back our kickstarter campaign to make clothing more playful and creative here: <a href="http://apliiq.it/TsYmsc" target="_blank">http://apliiq.it/TsYmsc</a></p>
