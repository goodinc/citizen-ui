Good is a web font containing glyphs for the GOOD logo.

The original shapes used to create the font files (good.svg, good.ttf, good.eot, and good.woff) are contained in this file:

good.original.svg


The font files were created by exporting each glyph as an SVG, and manually creating an SVG font file from them (good.original.font.svg).
