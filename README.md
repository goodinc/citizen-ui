## Good HTML

These are HTML prototypes that represent the basic structure for the good.is production site.

### Project Goals

* Make the site load faster

* Use less bandwidth for things like CSS and JavaScript

* Make the site usable on any device

* Make the site look good in modern browsers on any size screen

* Make the site more accessible for disabled users

* Allow users with old versions of Internet Explorer onto the site

* Remove the need for a separate mobile site (less code to maintain)

* Allow mobile users onto the main site so they get extra features like comments

* Simple, consistent HTML patterns so there won’t be a need to abstract into ruby

* Simple, consistent CSS patterns so we can reuse selectors and save bandwidth

* Match the existing site design as closely as possible
