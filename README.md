These are HTML prototypes that represent the good.is community site.

The site is published on GitHub:
<http://goodinc.github.io/citizen-ui/>

### Project Goals

* Make the site load fast.

* Use minimal bandwidth for images and styles.

* Make the site usable on any device.

* Make the site look good in modern browsers on any size screen.

* Make the site accessible for users with diverse input devices, like touchscreens and screen readers.

* Use simple, consistent HTML patterns to make integration with templates easy.

* Use simple, consistent CSS patterns so rules and selectors can be reused.
